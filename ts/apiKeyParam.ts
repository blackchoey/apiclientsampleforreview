// This file is auto generated by Teams Toolkit to provide you instructions and reference code to call your api.

/*
Your next steps:
1. Run npm install. If your project did not install @microsoft/teamsfx package before, we have added it to package.json for you.
   You need to run the command under "bot" folder instead of project's root folder.
2. Add your API Key to TEAMSFX_API_APIKEYPARAM_API_KEY in "bot/.env.teamsfx.local".

You can now import the API client (an Axios instance) in another file and call apiKeyParam APIs without worrying about authentication.
Here is an example for a GET request to "relative_path_of_target_api":
```
import { apiKeyParamClient } from "relative_path_to_this_file";

const response = await apiKeyParamClient.get("relative_path_of_target_api");
// You only need to enter the relative path for your API.
// For example, if you want to call api https://my-api-endpoint/test, and inputted https://my-api-endpoint as API endpoint,
// the code will looks like: const response = await apiKeyParamClient.get("test");

const responseBody = response.data;
```
